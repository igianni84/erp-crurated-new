## Codebase Patterns
- Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Export types from actions.ts for UI components
- Enums go in app/Enums/{ModuleName}/ directory
- Services go in app/Services/{ModuleName}/ directory
- Filament Resources follow existing patterns in app/Filament/Resources/
- Use Auditable trait for all entities requiring audit logs
- Wizard-style forms use Filament's wizard component with steps
- Soft deletes enabled on all main entities
- Morphic relations for product references (BottleSku or LiquidProduct)
