## Codebase Patterns
- Use `$table->uuid('id')->primary()` for model primary keys with HasUuid trait
- Models use Auditable trait with created_by/updated_by foreign keys to users
- Enums follow pattern: value cases with label(), color(), icon() methods
- Inventory module: app/Models/Inventory/, app/Enums/Inventory/, app/Services/Inventory/
- Services throw InvalidArgumentException for validation errors
- Fulfillment module will follow same patterns: app/Models/Fulfillment/, app/Enums/Fulfillment/, app/Services/Fulfillment/
