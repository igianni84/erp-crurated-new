## Codebase Patterns
- Use `HasUuid` trait for UUID primary keys (models should use `$table->uuid('id')->primary()` in migrations)
- Use `Auditable` trait for audit logging (requires `created_by`, `updated_by` columns and `auditLogs()` MorphMany relation)
- Use `SoftDeletes` trait for soft deletion support
- Enums should include `label()`, `color()`, and `icon()` methods for Filament UI compatibility
- Commercial entities go in `app/Enums/Commercial/` and `app/Models/Commercial/`
- Migration naming: `YYYY_MM_DD_NNNNNN_action_table_name.php` where NNNNNN is sequence number
- Filament resources: main class in `app/Filament/Resources/`, pages in `Pages/` subdirectory
- Filament navigation groups are defined in `AdminPanelProvider.php`
- Use `$navigationGroup = 'Commercial'` for all Commercial module resources
- For table-based list pages (not CRUD resources), use Filament Page with HasTable interface and InteractsWithTable trait
- Module configuration goes in `config/{module}.php` (e.g., `config/commercial.php`) and is accessed via `config('module.key')`

## 2026-02-03 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - ChannelType enum (b2c, b2b, private_club) with label/color/icon methods
  - ChannelStatus enum (active, inactive) with label/color/icon methods
  - Channel model with HasUuid, Auditable, SoftDeletes traits
  - channels migration with all required fields (name, channel_type, default_currency, allowed_commercial_models JSON, status)
- Files changed:
  - app/Enums/Commercial/ChannelType.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/ChannelStatus.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/Channel.php (created)
  - database/migrations/2026_02_03_380000_create_channels_table.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Follow the existing enum pattern with label(), color(), icon() methods for Filament compatibility
  - Channel model serves as the foundational commercial entity - other entities (PriceBook, Offer) will reference it
  - allowed_commercial_models is a JSON array that can contain 'voucher_based' and 'sell_through'
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - PriceBookStatus enum (draft, active, expired, archived)
  - PricingPolicyStatus enum (draft, active, paused, archived)
  - PricingPolicyType enum (cost_plus_margin, reference_price_book, index_based, fixed_adjustment, rounding)
  - PricingPolicyInputSource enum (cost, emp, price_book, external_index)
  - OfferStatus enum (draft, active, paused, expired, cancelled)
  - OfferType enum (standard, promotion, bundle)
  - OfferVisibility enum (public, restricted)
  - ExecutionCadence enum (manual, scheduled, event_triggered)
  - All enums follow the established pattern with label(), color(), icon() methods
- Files changed:
  - app/Enums/Commercial/PriceBookStatus.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/PricingPolicyStatus.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/PricingPolicyType.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/PricingPolicyInputSource.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/OfferStatus.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/OfferType.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/OfferVisibility.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/ExecutionCadence.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The established enum pattern continues to work well for all commercial status/type enums
  - PHPStan config has an unused ignored pattern for "trait.unused" - this is a config issue, not code issue
  - Enums provide consistent Filament UI elements through color() and icon() methods
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - EmpSource enum (livex, internal, composite) with label/color/icon methods
  - EmpConfidenceLevel enum (high, medium, low) with label/color/icon methods
  - EstimatedMarketPrice model with HasUuid trait and belongsTo SellableSku relationship
  - estimated_market_prices migration with unique constraint on sellable_sku_id + market
  - Freshness indicators (isFresh, isStale, getFreshnessIndicator) for data quality tracking
- Files changed:
  - app/Enums/Commercial/EmpSource.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/EmpConfidenceLevel.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/EstimatedMarketPrice.php (created)
  - database/migrations/2026_02_03_380001_create_estimated_market_prices_table.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - EMP is a read-only entity in Module S (imported from external process), so no Auditable trait needed
  - The unique constraint on sellable_sku_id + market ensures one EMP per SKU per market
  - Freshness indicators help UI display data quality (fresh < 24h, recent 1-7 days, stale > 7 days)
  - SellableSku uses uuid primary key, so foreign keys use foreignUuid() in migrations
---

  - Badge columns with enums use formatStateUsing, color, and icon callbacks
  - JSON array fields (like allowed_commercial_models) can be displayed as comma-separated badges
  - Navigation groups must be registered in AdminPanelProvider for proper sidebar organization
  - Use getEloquentQuery() to include soft-deleted records in the list view

  - Model helper methods (isExpiringSoon, isEditable) can be used in table column callbacks for conditional styling
  - Form fields can be conditionally disabled based on record state (e.g., status disabled for active Price Books)
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-012, US-013, US-014, US-015
- What was implemented:
  - Multi-step wizard for PriceBook creation using HasWizard trait
  - Step 1 (Metadata): name, market (searchable select with common markets), channel (optional), currency
  - Step 2 (Validity): valid_from, valid_to with after() validation, overlap detection with existing price books
  - Step 3 (Initial Prices): Radio selection between Empty, Clone, CSV (CSV marked as not implemented)

  - Use getOwnerRecord() in RelationManager closures with instanceof check for type safety
  - TernaryFilter with whereHas/whereDoesntHave enables filtering by related model existence
  - Bulk actions can use Collection and mutate records with custom logic
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-018
- What was implemented:
  - PriceBook activation workflow with approval role check (Manager+ required)
  - Approval records approved_at and approved_by fields on activation
  - Validation: at least 1 price entry must exist before activation
  - Overlap detection: finds active PriceBooks for same market/channel/currency
  - Auto-expire overlapping PriceBooks with user confirmation
  - Disabled "Activate" button with tooltip for users without approver role
  - Model helper methods: hasEntries(), canBeActivatedWithEntries(), findOverlappingActivePriceBooks(), hasOverlappingActivePriceBooks()
  - Prices already read-only after activation (via isEditable() from US-016)
- Files changed:
  - app/Models/User.php (modified - added canApprovePriceBooks() method)
  - app/Models/Commercial/PriceBook.php (modified - added overlap detection methods)
  - app/Filament/Resources/PriceBookResource/Pages/ViewPriceBook.php (modified - enhanced activate action with validation and overlap handling)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - User role checking for specific actions can be added via dedicated methods (canApprovePriceBooks)
  - UserRole enum hasAtLeast() method enables flexible permission checks (Manager+ means Manager, Admin, SuperAdmin)
  - Overlap detection for validity periods needs careful date comparison: check if new.valid_from <= existing.valid_to AND (existing.valid_from <= new.valid_to OR new.valid_to IS NULL)
  - Modal descriptions can use "\n" for multi-line text and bullet points for warnings
  - Disabled actions with tooltips provide good UX for explaining why actions are unavailable
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-019
- What was implemented:
  - PriceBookService class in `app/Services/Commercial/` centralizing all PriceBook business logic
  - `activate(PriceBook, User)` method: draft → active with approval, auto-expires overlapping PriceBooks
  - `archive(PriceBook)` method: active/expired → archived with audit logging
  - `expirePriceBook(PriceBook)` method: active → expired (internal helper)

- Files changed:
  - app/Services/Commercial/PriceBookService.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/PriceBookResource/Pages/ViewPriceBook.php (modified - uses service)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Services should be placed in `app/Services/{Module}/` directory (e.g., `app/Services/Commercial/`)
  - Service pattern: centralize business logic, return modified model, throw InvalidArgumentException for validation failures
  - DB::transaction() for multi-step operations (like cloning entries or expiring overlapping records)
  - Use `app(ServiceClass::class)` in Filament actions to resolve the service from container
  - Audit logging pattern: create audit log entry with old/new values via model's auditLogs() relationship
---

  - app/Models/Commercial/PriceBook.php (modified - added pricingPolicies relationship)
  - app/Models/Commercial/PriceBookEntry.php (modified - fixed pricingPolicy relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PricingPolicy generates prices into a target PriceBook, never activates the PriceBook directly
  - logic_definition is a flexible JSON field containing: margin_percentage, markup_value, rounding_rule, tiered_logic
  - Status transitions differ from PriceBook: draft→active→paused (bidirectional)→archived
  - getLogicDescription() provides user-friendly explanation of policy rules for UI display
  - Policies can be scheduled, event-triggered, or manual - stored in execution_cadence field

  - app/Models/Commercial/PricingPolicy.php (modified - added scope() relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PricingPolicyScope defines which SKUs a PricingPolicy applies to via scope_type
  - scope_reference holds the category/product/sku ID depending on scope_type (null for 'all')
  - Markets and channels arrays provide additional filtering beyond the base scope
  - hasOne relationship used instead of hasMany - each policy has exactly one scope definition
  - Scope resolution to actual Sellable SKUs will be handled by PricingPolicyService (US-032)
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-022

  - app/Models/Commercial/PricingPolicy.php (modified - added executions() relationship and helper methods)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PricingPolicyExecution logs are immutable - they cannot be modified after creation
  - Execution model does not use Auditable trait since logs are already immutable
  - getSuccessRate() calculates success percentage based on prices_generated vs errors_count
  - latestExecution() on PricingPolicy returns the most recent execution for quick status checks
  - ExecutionType.DryRun is for preview executions that don't write to the Price Book

  - Use Allocation::query()->where('wine_variant_id', ...)->where('format_id', ...) to find allocations for a SellableSku
  - AllocationConstraint::getEffectiveChannels() returns allowed channels for an allocation
  - EmpConfidenceLevel enum has a color() method that returns the Filament color name directly (no need for manual match)
  - For wizard submit actions with two buttons, use HtmlString with Blade template and wire:click to set a public property
  - SellableSku's wine_variant_id and format_id are non-nullable strings (UUIDs), don't need null checks per PHPStan

  - Validity & Visibility Summary section: offer name, type badge, visibility badge with icon, valid from/to dates, duration, campaign tag
  - Status & Next Steps section: explains Draft status, lists next steps after creation, explains "Create and Activate" option
  - Helper methods: hasConflictingOffers(), getConflictingOffersQuery(), buildConflictWarningHtml(), buildProductSummaryHtml(), buildChannelEligibilitySummaryHtml(), buildPricingSummaryHtml(), buildValiditySummaryHtml()
  - Conflict detection uses date overlap logic for validity periods (handles both bounded and indefinite offers)
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Resources/OfferResource/Pages/CreateOffer.php (modified - implemented Step 5 with full review and conflict detection)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Conflict detection for offers requires checking: same SKU + same channel + overlapping validity periods
  - Date overlap logic needs to handle: null valid_to (indefinite offers), bounded periods, and their combinations
  - PHPStan flow analysis tracks variable assignments inside conditionals - when `$finalPrice = $basePrice` and later `$finalPrice = match(...)` inside `if ($basePrice !== null)`, PHPStan knows both are linked
  - Review step sections should be collapsible to reduce visual clutter while keeping all info accessible
  - Color-coded badges (success/warning/info) help users quickly identify offer type and visibility settings
  - The "Create and Activate" dual-submit pattern uses wire:click="$set('property', value)" to track user choice
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-042
- What was implemented:
  - Offer Detail view with 7 tabs using Filament Infolist Tabs component
  - Tab Overview: offer info (name, type, visibility, status, campaign_tag), linked entities (channel, price book), validity period with expiring indicator, pricing summary (base_price, benefit, final_price, savings)
  - Tab Eligibility: eligibility overview summary, market restrictions, customer type restrictions, membership tier restrictions, allocation constraints with warning about precedence
  - Tab Benefit: benefit type/value/discount_rule configuration, benefit type description with color-coded panels, step-by-step price calculation breakdown showing base price → benefit → final price
  - Tab Products: sellable SKU info (sku_code, status, source, composite), wine information (name, vintage, format, packaging), integrity flags display, allocation lineage explanation, EMP reference table with market/value/confidence/freshness
  - Tab Priority & Conflicts: conflict detection with other offers (same SKU + channel + overlapping validity), conflict table with status/dates, resolution rules explanation, offer priority status display
  - Tab Simulation: price testing intro, current offer summary (SKU, channel, final price, status), eligibility test with current rules display, what-if analysis table showing different discount scenarios
  - Tab Audit: audit history with filter by event type/date, timestamps section, audit information about immutability
  - Header actions: Edit (visible for draft), Activate (with Price Book validation), Pause, Resume, Cancel
  - Activate action validates Price Book is active and warns about missing base price or conflicting offers
  - Conflict detection query uses date overlap logic handling null valid_to for indefinite offers
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Resources/OfferResource/Pages/ViewOffer.php (modified - added 7 tabs with complete implementation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Offer Detail follows the same pattern as PriceBook and PricingPolicy Detail views with tabbed infolist
  - For pricing summary, calculate final price using OfferBenefit.calculateFinalPrice(basePrice)
  - Conflict detection for offers requires checking: same sellable_sku_id + same channel_id + overlapping validity periods
  - PHPStan requires explicit null checks instead of nullsafe + coalesce pattern (e.g., use `$priceBook !== null ? $priceBook->currency : 'EUR'` instead of `$record->priceBook?->currency ?? 'EUR'`)
  - Tab badges with badgeColor can show conflict counts (e.g., `->badge(fn (): ?int => $count > 0 ? $count : null)`)
  - Header actions for status transitions include audit logging using `$record->auditLogs()->create()`
  - Activate action should validate that the referenced Price Book is active before allowing activation
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-043
- What was implemented:
  - Added validateEligibilityAgainstAllocation() method to Offer model for validating offer eligibility against allocation constraints
  - Validates markets against allocation constraint geographies
  - Validates customer types against allocation constraint customer types
  - Validates channel type against allocation constraint allowed channels
  - Added canActivateWithValidations() method for comprehensive activation validation (draft status, Price Book active, base price, eligibility)
  - Updated ViewOffer activate action to use canActivateWithValidations() for proper validation before activation
  - Created ExpireOffersJob in app/Jobs/Commercial/ for automatic offer expiration
  - Job finds active offers with valid_to < now() and transitions them to expired status
  - Creates audit logs for each automatic expiration with null user_id (system-initiated)
- Files changed:
  - app/Models/Commercial/Offer.php (modified - added eligibility validation methods)
  - app/Filament/Resources/OfferResource/Pages/ViewOffer.php (modified - updated activate action)
  - app/Jobs/Commercial/ExpireOffersJob.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AllocationConstraint has isGeographyAllowed(), isCustomerTypeAllowed(), isChannelAllowed() methods for validation
  - Offer eligibility stores allocation_constraint_id as a reference to the authoritative constraint
  - When eligibility has no allocation_constraint_id linked, validation is skipped (graceful degradation)
  - ExpireOffersJob should be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., every minute or every 5 minutes)
  - System-initiated audit logs use user_id = null to distinguish from user actions
  - canActivateWithValidations() returns both a boolean 'valid' flag and an 'errors' array for detailed feedback
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-044
- What was implemented:
  - BulkCreateOffers Filament Page for creating multiple offers at once
  - 5-step wizard: SKU Selection, Channel & Eligibility, Pricing, Validity & Visibility, Review & Create
  - Multi-select SKU picker with active allocation filtering
  - Channel selection with allocation constraint validation (shows which SKUs are valid for selected channel)
  - Price Book selection with price coverage preview (shows which SKUs have entries)
  - Shared benefit configuration (None, Percentage Discount, Fixed Discount, Fixed Price)
  - Shared validity period and visibility settings
  - Offer name prefix that generates unique names: "[Prefix] [Wine Name] [Vintage]"
  - Review step with full summary of offers to be created and excluded SKUs

  - Bulk action in Offer List header: "Bulk Create Offers" button
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Resources/OfferResource.php (modified - added bulk-create route)
  - app/Filament/Resources/OfferResource/Pages/ListOffers.php (modified - added header action)
  - app/Filament/Resources/OfferResource/Pages/BulkCreateOffers.php (created)
  - resources/views/filament/resources/offer-resource/pages/bulk-create-offers.blade.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For Filament Pages with forms, use `InteractsWithForms` trait and `HasForms` interface
  - Define forms using `getForms()` method that returns an array of form definitions
  - Use `@property Form $form` PHPDoc annotation to satisfy PHPStan for magic form property
  - SKU allocation validation for channel uses AllocationConstraint::getEffectiveChannels() and compares with channel_type enum value
  - Each SKU generates 1 independent Offer with shared configuration (channel, price book, eligibility, benefit, validity)
  - Bulk creation wraps all inserts in a DB::transaction() for atomic operations
  - Progress indicator uses Livewire's wire:loading directive on the submit button
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-045
- What was implemented:
  - OfferService class in `app/Services/Commercial/` centralizing all Offer business logic
  - `activate(Offer)` method: draft → active with full validation using canActivateWithValidations() (checks Price Book active, base price exists, eligibility valid)
  - `pause(Offer)` method: active → paused with audit logging
  - `resume(Offer)` method: paused → active with Price Book validation
  - `cancel(Offer)` method: any → cancelled (terminal state)
  - `expire(Offer)` method: active → expired (used by ExpireOffersJob)
  - `getActiveForContext(SellableSku, Channel, CustomerContext)` method: finds applicable active Offer with optional customer eligibility filtering
  - `getActiveOffersForContext(SellableSku, Channel)` method: finds all active offers for context
  - `resolvePrice(Offer)` method: calculates final price (base + benefit) returning PriceResolution value object
  - `resolvePriceValue(Offer)` method: convenience method returning decimal string
  - `validateEligibility(Offer, CustomerContext)` method: boolean eligibility check
  - `validateEligibilityDetailed(Offer, CustomerContext)` method: detailed eligibility validation with failure reasons
  - Helper methods: canActivate, canPause, canResume, canCancel
  - CustomerContext value object for customer data (market, customerType, membershipTier, customerId)
  - PriceResolution value object with formatted price methods and summary
  - EligibilityValidation value object with check results and failure reasons
  - ExpireOffersJob (created in US-043) handles auto-expire functionality
- Files changed:
  - app/Services/Commercial/OfferService.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Services should include helper value objects (CustomerContext, PriceResolution, EligibilityValidation) for structured return types
  - Use canActivateWithValidations() on model for comprehensive activation validation - returns { valid: bool, errors: array }
  - Price resolution uses OfferBenefit.calculateFinalPrice() for benefit calculations
  - Eligibility validation uses OfferEligibility.isContextEligible() for combined checks
  - Resume action should re-validate that Price Book is still active before resuming
  - Value objects with readonly properties provide immutable, typed return data
  - fromArray() static factory methods enable easy construction from form/request data
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-046
- What was implemented:
  - DiscountRuleType enum (percentage, fixed_amount, tiered, volume_based) with label/color/icon/description/example/supportsTiers/requiresValue/valueUnit methods
  - DiscountRuleStatus enum (active, inactive) with label/color/icon/description methods
  - DiscountRule model with HasUuid trait and logic_definition JSON field for flexible rule configuration
  - discount_rules migration with FK constraint to offer_benefits table
  - Rule type helpers: isPercentage, isFixedAmount, isTiered, isVolumeBased
  - Status helpers: isActive, isInactive, canBeDeactivated, canBeEdited, canBeDeleted
  - Logic definition accessors: getValue, getTiers, getThresholds
  - Discount calculation methods: calculateDiscount, calculateFinalPrice (with type-specific implementations)
  - Usage tracking: isReferencedByAnyOffer, hasActiveOffersUsing, getOffersUsingCount, getActiveOffersUsingCount
  - UI helpers: getSummary, getDetailedDescription with plain-language explanations
  - Query scopes: active(), ofType()
  - Updated OfferBenefit.discountRule() relationship to use actual DiscountRule class (replaced placeholder)
- Files changed:
  - app/Enums/Commercial/DiscountRuleType.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/DiscountRuleStatus.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/DiscountRule.php (created)
  - database/migrations/2026_02_04_380010_create_discount_rules_table.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/OfferBenefit.php (modified - updated discountRule relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - DiscountRules are definitions that are referenced by OfferBenefit entities, not applied directly
  - logic_definition JSON field structure varies by rule_type: percentage/fixed_amount use "value", tiered uses "tiers", volume_based uses "thresholds"
  - Rule editability and deletability depend on whether active Offers are using the rule (hasActiveOffersUsing())
  - PHPStan type annotations for array shapes (e.g., array{min_qty: int, value: float}) enable strict type checking
  - When PHPStan knows array offsets exist from type annotations, don't use null coalescing (??) operators
  - offerBenefits() hasMany relationship enables usage tracking via whereHas queries
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-047
- What was implemented:
  - DiscountRuleResource Filament resource with navigation group 'Commercial' and sort order 6
  - List view with columns: name (searchable, sortable), rule_type (badge), summary (plain-language via getSummary()), status (badge), offers_using_count (sorted by count)
  - Filters: rule_type (select), status (select)
  - Search by name
  - Bulk actions: Activate Selected, Deactivate Selected (with active Offers check), Delete (with referential integrity check)
  - View action for all records, Edit action only for editable rules
  - Delete prevention for rules referenced by any Offer
  - Standard CRUD pages: ListDiscountRules, CreateDiscountRule, ViewDiscountRule, EditDiscountRule
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource/Pages/ListDiscountRules.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource/Pages/CreateDiscountRule.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource/Pages/ViewDiscountRule.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource/Pages/EditDiscountRule.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - DiscountRule model has getSummary() method for plain-language rule description
  - Use sortable() with query callback for computed columns like offers_using_count (uses withCount)
  - For bulk delete actions, use before() hook to check referential integrity and cancel if needed
  - PHPStan doesn't like Collection::contains() with typed closures on generic collections - use foreach loop instead
  - canBeEdited(), canBeDeleted(), isReferencedByAnyOffer() model helpers control UI action visibility
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-048
- What was implemented:
  - Full CRUD for DiscountRule with dynamic logic builder based on rule type
  - Create form with name, rule_type radio selection with descriptions and examples
  - Dynamic logic configuration section with type-specific inputs:
    - Percentage: single value input with % suffix (0-100)
    - Fixed Amount: single value input with € prefix
    - Tiered: Repeater with min/max price range and discount percentage per tier
    - Volume-Based: Repeater with min_qty threshold and fixed discount amount
  - Plain-language preview showing rule summary and example calculations
  - View page with detailed infolist showing logic configuration, tier/threshold tables, usage statistics
  - Edit page with access control (blocks editing if active Offers use the rule)
  - Delete protection (cannot delete if referenced by any Offer)
  - Activate/Deactivate header actions in view page
  - Form data cleaning in mutateFormDataBeforeCreate/Save to properly structure logic_definition JSON
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource.php (modified - added full form with dynamic logic builder and preview)
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource/Pages/CreateDiscountRule.php (modified - added form data cleaning)
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource/Pages/EditDiscountRule.php (modified - added access control and form data cleaning)
  - app/Filament/Resources/DiscountRuleResource/Pages/ViewDiscountRule.php (modified - added full infolist with logic configuration display)
  - app/Models/Commercial/DiscountRule.php (modified - updated PHPDoc types for getTiers/getThresholds)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Repeater component for dynamic array inputs (tiers, thresholds) with min/default items
  - Form data from Filament forms comes as mixed types - use liberal type annotations (array<string, mixed>) and extract with ?? null pattern
  - mutateFormDataBeforeCreate/Save is the right place to clean and restructure form data for JSON columns
  - Use authorizeAccess() in EditRecord pages to redirect away if record is not editable
  - Radio component with descriptions() provides better UX than Select for rule type selection
  - Live preview with example calculations helps users understand rule configuration
  - For tables with mixed types (tiers with optional max), iterate with explicit null checks and ?? defaults
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-049
- What was implemented:
  - BundlePricingLogic enum (sum_components, fixed_price, percentage_off_sum) with label/color/icon/description/example/requiresFixedPrice/requiresPercentage/isAutomatic methods
  - BundleStatus enum (draft, active, inactive) with label/color/icon/description methods
  - Bundle model with HasUuid and SoftDeletes traits
  - bundles migration with: id (uuid), name, bundle_sku (unique), pricing_logic (enum), fixed_price (decimal nullable), percentage_off (decimal nullable), status (enum)
  - Status helper methods: isDraft, isActive, isInactive, canBeActivated, canBeDeactivated, isEditable
  - Pricing logic helpers: isSumComponents, isFixedPrice, isPercentageOffSum, getFixedPriceValue, getPercentageOffValue
  - Component helpers: hasComponents, getComponentsCount, getTotalComponentQuantity
  - UI helpers: getPricingLogicLabel/Color/Icon, getStatusLabel/Color/Icon, getPricingSummary, getDetailedDescription
  - Query scopes: draft, active, inactive, withPricingLogic
  - Placeholder components() hasMany relationship (BundleComponent model to be created in US-050)
- Files changed:
  - app/Enums/Commercial/BundlePricingLogic.php (created)
  - app/Enums/Commercial/BundleStatus.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/Bundle.php (created)
  - database/migrations/2026_02_04_380011_create_bundles_table.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When a model has a relationship to a class that doesn't exist yet (like BundleComponent), use a string class reference and @phpstan-ignore argument.type annotation
  - Bundle model includes percentage_off field for the percentage_off_sum pricing logic, not just fixed_price
  - Bundle generates a composite Sellable SKU in PIM - the bundle_sku field stores this reference
  - Activation requires at least one component (enforced in canBeActivated() method)
  - Only draft bundles can be edited (isEditable() returns true only for draft status)
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-050
- What was implemented:
  - BundleComponent model with HasUuid trait and belongsTo relationships (Bundle, SellableSku)
  - bundle_components migration with: id (uuid), bundle_id (FK), sellable_sku_id (FK), quantity (int default 1)
  - Unique constraint on bundle_id + sellable_sku_id (a SKU can only appear once in a bundle)
  - Cascade delete on both FKs
  - Quantity validation helper: hasValidQuantity() checks quantity > 0
  - SKU validation helpers: hasActiveSku(), hasAllocation()
  - Display helpers: getSkuCode(), getDisplayString(), getWineName(), getVintageYear(), getDetailedDescription()
  - Validation method: validate() returns array of errors, isValid() returns boolean
  - Updated Bundle.components() relationship to use actual BundleComponent class (removed @phpstan-ignore)
  - Added bundleComponents() hasMany relationship to SellableSku model
- Files changed:
  - app/Models/Commercial/BundleComponent.php (created)
  - database/migrations/2026_02_04_380012_create_bundle_components_table.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/Bundle.php (modified - updated components relationship)
  - app/Models/Pim/SellableSku.php (modified - added bundleComponents relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BundleComponent links Sellable SKUs (not Bottle SKUs) to bundles with quantity
  - Components are Sellable SKUs which include full commercial packaging specification (wine variant + format + case configuration)
  - Unique constraint ensures a SKU can only appear once per bundle - use quantity field for multiples
  - hasAllocation() checks if the component's SKU has an active allocation by matching wine_variant_id + format_id
  - When a placeholder relationship is replaced with the actual class, remove the @phpstan-ignore annotation
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-051
- What was implemented:
  - BundleResource Filament resource with navigation group 'Commercial' and sort order 7
  - List view with columns: name (searchable, sortable), bundle_sku (searchable, sortable, copyable), pricing_logic (badge), components_count (badge with count), status (badge), computed_price (dynamic display based on pricing_logic)
  - Filters: status (select), pricing_logic (select), trashed (soft-delete filter)
  - Search by name and bundle_sku
  - Bulk actions: Activate Selected (with component check), Deactivate Selected, Delete, Force Delete, Restore
  - View action for all records, Edit action only for editable (draft) bundles
  - Form with sections: Bundle Information (name, bundle_sku), Pricing Configuration (pricing_logic, fixed_price, percentage_off), Status
  - Dynamic pricing fields shown/hidden based on pricing_logic selection
  - Standard CRUD pages: ListBundles, CreateBundle, ViewBundle, EditBundle
  - EditBundle page redirects to view if bundle is not editable (not in draft status)
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource/Pages/ListBundles.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource/Pages/CreateBundle.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource/Pages/ViewBundle.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource/Pages/EditBundle.php (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BundleResource follows the same pattern as DiscountRuleResource and other Commercial resources
  - Use withoutGlobalScopes([SoftDeletingScope::class]) instead of withTrashed() to satisfy PHPStan
  - computed_price is a dynamic display based on pricing_logic (sum of components, fixed price, or percentage off sum)
  - canBeActivated() checks both isDraft() AND hasComponents() - bulk activate skips bundles without components
  - authorizeAccess() in EditRecord can redirect away from edit page if record is not editable
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-052
- What was implemented:
  - Converted CreateBundle page to multi-step wizard using HasWizard trait with 4 steps:
    - Step 1 (Bundle Information): name, bundle_sku (auto-generated if empty)
    - Step 2 (Components): Repeater-based component selection with Sellable SKU dropdown and quantity input
    - Step 3 (Pricing): pricing_logic radio selection, fixed_price/percentage_off inputs based on logic
    - Step 4 (Review): summary of all bundle configuration with dual submit buttons (Create as Draft / Create and Activate)
  - ComponentsRelationManager for managing bundle components in view/edit pages
  - Table with columns: SKU Code, Wine Name, Format, Packaging, Quantity (inline editable), SKU Status, Allocation Status
  - Create/Edit/Delete actions visible only when bundle is in Draft status
  - Validation to prevent deleting all components (bundle must have at least one)
  - ViewBundle enhanced with 3 tabs: Overview, Pricing, Manage Components
  - Tab Overview: bundle info, components summary, component list with validation status
  - Tab Pricing: pricing configuration, pricing details with description/example, computed price preview against active Price Books
  - Tab Manage Components: info banner explaining component editing status, relation manager embedded
  - Header actions: Edit (draft only), Activate (with component validation), Deactivate, Reactivate, Delete
  - Added calculateBundlePrice() method to Bundle model for computing bundle price based on pricing_logic
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource.php (modified - registered ComponentsRelationManager)
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource/Pages/CreateBundle.php (modified - converted to wizard)
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource/Pages/ViewBundle.php (modified - added 3 tabs and header actions)
  - app/Filament/Resources/BundleResource/RelationManagers/ComponentsRelationManager.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/Bundle.php (modified - added calculateBundlePrice method)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For wizard-based create pages, use HasWizard trait with getSteps() returning Wizard\Step array
  - Dual submit buttons use HtmlString with wire:click="$set('property', value)" to track user choice
  - ComponentsRelationManager follows standard RelationManager pattern with form() and table() methods
  - Use TextInputColumn for inline quantity editing with afterStateUpdated callback
  - TextEntry with getStateUsing() and ->html() is the correct pattern for custom HTML content in Infolists (not Placeholder)
  - PHPStan's vintage_year null checks are unnecessary since it's cast to integer - use direct cast instead
  - Session-based data passing between mutateFormDataBeforeCreate() and afterCreate() for non-model data
---

---

## 2026-02-04 - US-054
- What was implemented:
  - PriceSimulation Filament page under Commercial navigation group
  - Form with inputs: sellable_sku_id (searchable select with auto-suggest), customer_id (optional, searchable), channel_id (select), date (datepicker), quantity (numeric)
  - SKU preview showing wine details, format, packaging, status, and EMP reference

  - app/Filament/Pages/PriceSimulation.php (created)
  - resources/views/filament/pages/price-simulation.blade.php (created)
  - prd.json (updated US-054 passes: true)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Filament form pages use InteractsWithForms trait and implement HasForms interface
  - For form data, use public array property with statePath() and access via $this->data directly
  - Avoid $this->form property access in mount() - instead populate $this->data directly
  - PHPStan doesn't like nullsafe operator (?->) on left side of ?? - use ternary instead
  - Wire directives like wire:click and wire:target work with Livewire methods for interactivity
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-055
- What was implemented:
  - SimulationResult DTO with full breakdown structure for price simulation
  - SimulationContext for holding input parameters (SKU, Channel, Customer, date, quantity)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - DTOs go in `app/DataTransferObjects/{Module}/` directory
  - Multiple classes can be defined in a single file for cohesive value objects
  - PHPStan is strict about nullsafe operators - use ternary when mixing with ?? operator
  - OfferBenefit has `getBenefitSummary()` and `isPercentageDiscount()` (not `getDescription()` or `isPercentage()`)
  - PriceBook.valid_from and Offer.valid_from are non-nullable Carbon dates
  - The simulation page provides the display structure; SimulationService (US-056) will centralize the logic
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-056
- What was implemented:
  - SimulationService class in `app/Services/Commercial/` for pricing simulation calculations

## 2026-02-04 - US-057
- What was implemented:
  - Full Commercial Overview dashboard as landing page for Commercial module
  - Active Price Books widget: count by status (draft/active/expired/archived), expiring soon indicator (30 days)
  - Active Offers widget: count by status (draft/active/paused/expired/cancelled), expiring soon indicator (7 days)
  - Pricing Policies widget: count by status with failed executions count, recent executions list with status
  - EMP Coverage widget: SKUs with EMP / total SKUs, coverage percentage progress bar, markets covered count
  - Alerts summary bar: total alerts count with expiring offers, expiring price books, policy failures, stale EMP data
  - Recent Policy Executions section: last 5 executions with policy name, status, execution time
  - Quick Actions section: Create Price Book, Create Offer, Create Pricing Policy, Price Simulation, View Pricing Intelligence
  - Updated isPriceBookAvailable() and isOfferAvailable() to return true (features are now implemented)
  - Added isPricingPolicyAvailable() method
  - Added getResourceUrls() method for linking to resource list pages
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Pages/CommercialOverview.php (modified - added real statistics methods)
  - resources/views/filament/pages/commercial-overview.blade.php (modified - replaced placeholders with real widgets)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dashboard widgets use direct Eloquent queries for statistics (count, whereHas, groupBy)
  - Status badges can be styled inline using match() expressions for Filament colors
  - Alert severity calculation uses percentage thresholds (>25% danger, >10% warning, else success)
  - Recent executions use eager loading with limit for efficient data retrieval
  - Progress bars for coverage use inline style width percentage
  - Quick actions array now includes 'enabled' flag for conditional rendering

## 2026-02-04 - US-058
- What was implemented:
  - CommercialCalendar Filament Page under Commercial navigation group
  - Calendar view with month and week display modes
  - Events: Price Book validity periods (green), Offer validity periods (blue), Pricing Policy scheduled executions (indigo)
  - Filters: event type (Price Books, Offers, Scheduled Policies) and channel
  - Navigation: previous/next period, "Today" button, toggle month/week view
  - Click on event opens the detail page for that entity
  - Event list panel below calendar showing all events in the current period
  - Updated CommercialOverview with Calendar link in Quick Actions
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Pages/CommercialCalendar.php (created)
  - resources/views/filament/pages/commercial-calendar.blade.php (created)
  - app/Filament/Pages/CommercialOverview.php (modified - added Calendar to quick actions and resource URLs)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Calendar views use Livewire wire:click and wire:model.live for real-time interactivity
  - Carbon's startOfWeek(), endOfWeek(), startOfMonth(), endOfMonth() are useful for date range calculations
  - Events with date ranges need careful comparison logic (event.start <= dayDate <= event.end)
  - Scheduled policy events are generated dynamically based on execution_cadence and schedule info
  - Color coding by event type helps visual distinction (green=PriceBook, blue=Offer, indigo=Policy)

## 2026-02-04 - US-059
- What was implemented:
  - Upcoming Expirations widget in Commercial Overview dashboard
  - getUpcomingExpirations() method: queries active Offers expiring within 7 days and active Price Books expiring within 30 days
  - Results ordered by expiration date (ascending, soonest first)
  - Each item includes: name, type, valid_to date, days_until_expiry, urgency level, URL to detail page, extra_info (channel for Offers, market/currency for Price Books)
  - getExpirationUrgency() method: returns 'critical' (<3 days), 'warning' (3-6 days), 'normal' (7+ days)
  - Widget displays two columns: Expiring Offers and Expiring Price Books
  - Visual urgency indicators: critical items have danger border/background, warning items have warning border/background
  - Badge displays days until expiry with exclamation icon for critical items
  - "Today" and "1 day" singular/plural handling
  - Links to detail page for each expiring item
  - Widget only shows when there are expirations (conditional rendering)
  - Empty state with check-circle icon when no items expiring in each category
- Files changed:
  - app/Filament/Pages/CommercialOverview.php (modified - added getUpcomingExpirations() and getExpirationUrgency() methods)
  - resources/views/filament/pages/commercial-overview.blade.php (modified - added Upcoming Expirations widget section)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Carbon's diffInDays() with second parameter false returns positive numbers for future dates
  - Widget conditional rendering uses @if($expirations['total'] > 0) to hide when empty
  - Blade's match() expression works inline for dynamic CSS classes
  - Extra info field provides context (channel for Offers, market/currency for Price Books)
  - Urgency thresholds: <3 days = critical (danger), 3-6 days = warning, 7+ days = normal

  - Added auditLogs() MorphMany relationship to all affected models
  - Added Tab Audit to ViewDiscountRule (converted to tabbed layout with Overview, Logic, Usage, Audit tabs)
  - Added Tab Audit to ViewBundle (added as 4th tab alongside Overview, Pricing, Manage Components)
  - Audit tabs include filtering by event type and date range, with immutable log display
- Files changed:
  - database/migrations/2026_02_04_380013_add_auditable_columns_to_commercial_tables.php (created)
  - app/Models/Commercial/PriceBookEntry.php (modified - added Auditable trait and auditLogs relationship)

  - PricingPolicy had Auditable trait but was missing the migration columns - combined fix in one migration
  - ViewDiscountRule was originally a simple infolist - converted to tabs for consistency with other Commercial views
