## Codebase Patterns
- Use `HasUuid` trait for all models (UUID primary key)
- Use `Auditable` trait for created_by/updated_by tracking
- Use `SoftDeletes` trait for all business models
- UUID foreign keys: `$table->uuid('field_id')` then `$table->foreign('field_id')->references('id')->on('table')`
- Integer FK to users: `$table->foreignId('created_by')->nullable()->constrained('users')->nullOnDelete()`
- Enums: backed string enums with `label()`, `color()`, `icon()` helpers
- Status enum values as Filament colors: success/danger/warning/info/gray
- Model boot() method for validation guards on updating
- Index names limited to 64 chars (MySQL) - use custom names for compound indexes

## 2026-02-04 - US-C001
- **What was implemented:** ShippingOrder model, migration, and related enums
- **Files changed:**
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_04_200000_create_shipping_orders_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrder.php` (new)
  - `app/Enums/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderStatus.php` (new)
  - `app/Enums/Fulfillment/PackagingPreference.php` (new)
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_04_100001_create_inbound_batches_table.php` (fixed index name)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ShippingOrderStatus enum has `canTransitionTo()` method for workflow validation
  - Status workflow: draft→planned→picking→shipped→completed, any→cancelled/on_hold
  - OnHold stores previous_status for restoration
  - hasMany relationships to future models removed to avoid phpstan errors
  - Run migrations first to discover DB errors before typecheck
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C002 + US-C005
- **What was implemented:** Shipment model, migration, ShipmentStatus enum
- **Files changed:**
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_04_210000_create_shipments_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/Shipment.php` (new)
  - `app/Enums/Fulfillment/ShipmentStatus.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrder.php` (added shipments() HasMany relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Shipment model enforces immutability of `shipped_bottle_serials` after confirmation via boot() updating guard
  - ShipmentStatus terminal states: delivered, failed
  - Shipment requires shipping_order_id (NOT NULL) - enforces no standalone shipments
  - JSON field `shipped_bottle_serials` stores bottle serials as immutable record
  - US-C005 (ShipmentStatus enum) was implemented together with US-C002 since required for model
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C003
- **What was implemented:** ShippingOrderLine model and migration
- **Files changed:**
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_04_220000_create_shipping_order_lines_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderLine.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrder.php` (added lines() HasMany relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ShippingOrderLine enforces allocation_id immutability via boot() updating guard
  - Status uses string constants until ShippingOrderLineStatus enum (US-C007) is implemented
  - The cases table is referenced as `cases` not `inventory_cases` (model is InventoryCase)
  - 1 voucher = 1 line = 1 bottle invariant enforced via model design
  - early_binding_serial for Module D personalization, bound_bottle_serial for late binding from WMS
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C007
- **What was implemented:** ShippingOrderLineStatus enum and integration into ShippingOrderLine model
- **Files changed:**
  - `app/Enums/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderLineStatus.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderLine.php` (updated to use enum)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Enum includes `allowsBinding()` method - binding only allowed in Validated status
  - Terminal states: Shipped, Cancelled
  - Transitions: pending→validated→picked→shipped, any→cancelled
  - Also marked US-C004 and US-C006 as passing - they were already implemented in US-C001
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C008 + US-C009
- **What was implemented:** ShippingOrderException model, migration, and ShippingOrderExceptionType enum

  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderException.php` (new)
  - `app/Enums/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderExceptionType.php` (new)
  - `app/Enums/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderExceptionStatus.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrder.php` (added exceptions() HasMany relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Created additional ShippingOrderExceptionStatus enum for active/resolved status (not in original PRD but needed)
  - Exception types have `isBlocking()` method to determine if they block SO progression
  - Exception can be order-level or line-level (nullable shipping_order_line_id)
  - All exceptions require manual review (canAutoResolve() returns false)
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C010
- **What was implemented:** ShippingOrderAuditLog model and migration for immutable audit logs
- **Files changed:**
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_04_240000_create_shipping_order_audit_logs_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderAuditLog.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Fulfillment/ShippingOrder.php` (added shippingOrderAuditLogs() HasMany relationship)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Audit logs do NOT use SoftDeletes - they are immutable
  - Only has `created_at` timestamp (no `updated_at`) since records cannot be modified
  - boot() guards prevent both updating and deleting
  - Method `hasChangeTracking()` instead of `hasChanges()` to avoid conflict with Model base class
  - Uses HasUuid trait but NOT Auditable (no created_by/updated_by needed, has user_id instead)
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C011
- **What was implemented:** ShippingOrderService for centralized Shipping Order management
- **Files changed:**
  - `app/Services/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderService.php` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service methods: create(), validateVouchers(), transitionTo(), cancel(), lockVouchersForSO(), unlockVouchers()
  - Uses VoucherService.lockForFulfillment() and unlock() for voucher lifecycle management
  - Voucher eligibility checks: lifecycle_state=issued, not suspended, no pending transfer, not quarantined, allocation lineage valid
  - Prevents same voucher in multiple active SOs (draft/planned/picking/on_hold)
  - Pre-transition hook validates vouchers before planning
  - Post-transition hook locks vouchers when moving to planned, unlocks when cancelled
  - Event constants defined for audit logging: EVENT_CREATED, EVENT_STATUS_CHANGE, etc.
  - Uses ShippingOrderAuditLog for event logging (not morphMany auditLogs)
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C012
- **What was implemented:** LateBindingService for centralized Late Binding logic
- **Files changed:**
  - `app/Services/Fulfillment/LateBindingService.php` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service methods: requestEligibleInventory(), bindVoucherToBottle(), validateBinding(), validateEarlyBinding(), unbindLine()
  - Uses InventoryService for bottle queries and InventoryCase for intact case checks
  - Binding only allowed in Validated status (via ShippingOrderLineStatus.allowsBinding())
  - Allocation lineage mismatch throws explicit exception: "Cross-allocation substitution not allowed"
  - Bottle state transitions: stored → reserved_for_picking upon binding, reversed on unbind
  - Early binding validation has NO fallback to late binding - creates ShippingOrderException if fails
  - Cache TTL of 5 minutes for inventory queries to balance freshness and performance
  - Event constants for audit logging: EVENT_BINDING_REQUESTED, EVENT_BINDING_EXECUTED, etc.
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-C013
- **What was implemented:** ShipmentService for centralized Shipment logic
- **Files changed:**
  - `app/Services/Fulfillment/ShipmentService.php` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service methods: createFromOrder(), confirmShipment(), triggerRedemption(), triggerOwnershipTransfer(), updateTracking(), markDelivered(), markFailed()
  - confirmShipment() is the "point of no return" - triggers voucher redemption and ownership transfer
  - Redemption is IRREVERSIBLE - uses VoucherService.redeem() for each voucher
  - Ownership transfer updates bottle state to Shipped via BottleState enum
  - Shipment can only be created from SO in Picking status with all bindings complete
  - Uses LateBindingService.checkAllLinesBinding() and validateAllBindings() before shipment creation
  - Line statuses updated during flow: Validated → Picked (createFromOrder), Picked → Shipped (confirmShipment)
  - Provenance blockchain update would be dispatched as a job (placeholder noted for US-C042)
  - markDelivered() optionally completes the SO if in Shipped status
  - Event constants for audit logging: EVENT_SHIPMENT_CREATED, EVENT_SHIPMENT_CONFIRMED, EVENT_VOUCHER_REDEEMED, etc.

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service methods: lockForShippingOrder(), lockAllForShippingOrder(), unlock(), unlockAllForShippingOrder(), isLockedForSO(), getLockedVouchers()
  - Provides integration layer between Fulfillment module and Module A VoucherService
  - Uses VoucherService.lockForFulfillment() and unlock() for actual lifecycle transitions
  - lockForShippingOrder() validates voucher is in the SO before locking
  - lockAllForShippingOrder() has atomic rollback - unlocks already-locked vouchers if any lock fails
  - isLockedForSO() checks both lifecycle state AND SO membership
  - Helper methods: validateCanLock(), isVoucherInActiveShippingOrder(), findShippingOrderForLockedVoucher()
  - Event constants for audit logging: EVENT_VOUCHER_LOCKED, EVENT_VOUCHER_UNLOCKED, EVENT_LOCK_FAILED, EVENT_UNLOCK_FAILED
  - Existing ShippingOrderService already has similar methods - VoucherLockService provides dedicated service for lock management
---

- **What was implemented:** WmsIntegrationService for centralized WMS integration
- **Files changed:**
  - `app/Services/Fulfillment/WmsIntegrationService.php` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service methods: sendPickingInstructions(), receivePickingFeedback(), validateSerials(), confirmShipment(), handleDiscrepancy(), requestRePick(), checkPickingCompletion()
  - Bidirectional WMS communication: outbound (picking instructions) and inbound (feedback/confirmation)
  - Picked serials MUST match allocation lineage - hard constraint enforced via validateSerial()
  - Invalid picks create WmsDiscrepancy exceptions automatically via handleDiscrepancy()
  - No manual acceptance of invalid picks - operator can only request re-pick
  - Early binding takes precedence - lines with early binding are skipped in WMS feedback processing
  - Partial shipments NOT supported in MVP - creates exception and blocks confirmation
  - Uses LateBindingService.bindVoucherToBottle() for binding execution after validation
  - buildPickingPayload() constructs WMS message with binding_type (early/late) and allocation constraints
  - Event constants for audit logging: EVENT_WMS_INSTRUCTIONS_SENT, EVENT_WMS_FEEDBACK_RECEIVED, EVENT_WMS_SERIAL_VALIDATED, EVENT_WMS_DISCREPANCY, etc.
  - Message IDs generated as WMS-{timestamp}-{id} for tracking

## 2026-02-04 - US-C029
- **What was implemented:** SO Actions e State Transitions - contextual header actions for all status transitions
- **Files changed:**
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Fulfillment/ShippingOrderResource/Pages/ViewShippingOrder.php` (added state transition actions)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Header actions organized by status visibility: Draft (Plan Order, Edit, Cancel), Planned (Send to Picking, Cancel, Put on Hold), Picking (Confirm Shipment, Put on Hold), On Hold (Resume, Cancel)
  - Shipped/Completed status shows no transition actions (read-only)
  - Send to Picking action: transitions to Picking status AND sends WMS instructions via WmsIntegrationService.sendPickingInstructions()
  - Confirm Shipment action: creates shipment via ShipmentService.createFromOrder(), confirms it, transitions SO to Shipped - this is the "point of no return" that triggers voucher redemption
  - Put on Hold action: stores previous_status on model before transition for later resume functionality
  - Resume action: transitions from OnHold back to previous_status (Draft, Planned, Picking, or Shipped)
  - Cancel action: requires reason text, calls ShippingOrderService.cancel() which handles voucher unlocking and binding cleanup
  - All actions use `->requiresConfirmation()` with detailed `->modalDescription()` explaining consequences
  - Actions use `->visible()` based on current status to show only valid transitions
  - Confirm Shipment additionally uses `->disabled()` when not all lines are bound (checks `getBindingCompletion()['all_bound']`)
  - Manual audit logging for Put on Hold and Resume actions using ShippingOrderAuditLog::create() with event types 'put_on_hold' and 'resumed_from_hold'
  - Service methods handle most audit logging automatically (ShippingOrderService.transitionTo() logs EVENT_STATUS_CHANGE)
  - Browser verification pending

  - Three validation checkpoints: (1) SO creation in validateVouchersForCreation(), (2) planning in handlePreTransition(), (3) pre-picking in handlePreTransition()
  - checkIfBlocked() returns {blocked, ineligible_count, errors} for UI blocking banners
  - getVoucherEligibilitySummary() returns detailed per-voucher eligibility info
  - canProceed() provides quick boolean check for state transitions
  - EVENT_VOUCHER_INELIGIBLE constant added for audit logging when vouchers become ineligible during lifecycle
  - Pre-picking validation logs individual voucher ineligibility events before throwing exception
  - Allocation::isClosed() checks if allocation is in Closed status (not available for fulfillment)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This story was already fully implemented as part of US-C003 and US-C012
  - ShippingOrderLine boot() guard prevents modification of allocation_id with error: "allocation_id is immutable after creation. Cross-allocation substitution is not allowed."
  - LateBindingService.bindVoucherToBottle() validates allocation match with error: "Allocation lineage mismatch. Cross-allocation substitution not allowed."
  - WmsIntegrationService.validateSerial() also validates allocation match with same error message
  - No override or bypass mechanisms exist in the codebase (verified via grep search)
  - All validation points use consistent error messaging about cross-allocation substitution
