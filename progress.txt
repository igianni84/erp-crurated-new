## Codebase Patterns
- PIM models go in `app/Models/Pim/` namespace
- PIM Filament resources go in `app/Filament/Resources/Pim/` namespace
- Use `HasUuid` trait with `$table->uuid('id')->primary()` instead of `$table->id()`
- Use `Auditable` trait with `created_by` and `updated_by` foreign keys
- Use `SoftDeletes` trait with `$table->softDeletes()` for referential integrity
- JSON fields use `'field_name' => 'array'` cast and `KeyValue` form component
- Navigation group for PIM is 'PIM', sort order starts at 1

## 2026-02-03 16:56 CET - US-001
- Implemented Wine Master model with all required fields
- Files changed:
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_03_155637_create_wine_masters_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Pim/WineMaster.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Pim/WineMasterResource.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Pim/WineMasterResource/Pages/ListWineMasters.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Pim/WineMasterResource/Pages/CreateWineMaster.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Pim/WineMasterResource/Pages/EditWineMaster.php` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: PIM models/resources have their own Pim subdirectory namespace
  - Use `KeyValue` component for JSON regulatory_attributes field
  - Use `TrashedFilter` for soft-deleted models in table filters
  - Table columns: searchable on name/producer/appellation per requirements
