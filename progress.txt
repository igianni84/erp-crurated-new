## Codebase Patterns
- PIM models go in `app/Models/Pim/` namespace
- PIM Filament resources go in `app/Filament/Resources/Pim/` namespace
- Use `HasUuid` trait with `$table->uuid('id')->primary()` instead of `$table->id()`
- Use `Auditable` trait with `created_by` and `updated_by` foreign keys
- Use `AuditLoggable` trait for automatic audit logging to `audit_logs` table (tracks create, update, delete, status_change)
- For optional model constants in traits, use `defined()` + `constant()` with PHPDoc to satisfy PHPStan
- Use `SoftDeletes` trait with `$table->softDeletes()` for referential integrity
- JSON fields use `'field_name' => 'array'` cast and `KeyValue` form component
- Navigation group for PIM is 'PIM', sort order starts at 1
- For enum match arms, use PHPDoc `@var 'val1'|'val2'|'val3'` annotation to satisfy PHPStan
- For nested resources, create RelationManager in `Resource/RelationManagers/` and register in `getRelations()`
- For enum-cast properties used in traits, add `@property EnumClass $property_name` PHPDoc on the model class
- Use `HasProductLifecycle` trait and `ProductLifecycleStatus` enum for PIM models with approval workflow

  - When accessing related model properties via BelongsTo, use PHPDoc `@var` annotation for PHPStan
  - Navigation sort for CaseConfiguration = 4 (after Format=3)

  - Auto-generate SKU codes in model `boot()` method with `static::creating()` callback
  - For match arms on enum DB columns, use PHPDoc annotation `@var 'val1'|'val2'|'val3'` to avoid PHPStan "match.alwaysTrue" errors
  - Filter cascaded selects using `->relationship()` with callback: `fn ($query, $get) => $query->when($get('parent_field'), fn ($q, $val) => $q->where('field', $val))`
  - Navigation sort for SellableSku = 5 (after CaseConfiguration=4)
  - Unique constraint across multiple columns: `$table->unique(['col1', 'col2', 'col3'], 'constraint_name')`

- Implemented completeness percentage for Wine Variant
- Files changed:
  - `app/Models/Pim/WineVariant.php` (modified - added getCompletenessPercentage(), getCompletenessColor(), isFieldComplete(), getIncompleteRequiredFields() methods and COMPLETENESS_FIELDS constant)

  - Define completeness field weights in a model constant `COMPLETENESS_FIELDS` with `weight` and `required` keys
  - Use `getAttribute()` method instead of direct property access to avoid PHPStan type errors for nullable fields
  - Use `empty()` check for array-casted JSON fields rather than `is_array()` which PHPStan flags as always true

  - Use polymorphic `morphMany`/`morphTo` for generic audit logging across multiple models
  - For optional constants in traits (e.g., AUDIT_EXCLUDE_FIELDS), use `defined($constantName)` check + `constant($constantName)` function to avoid PHPStan errors
  - AuditLog events: 'created', 'updated', 'deleted', 'status_change'
  - Define AUDIT_TRACK_STATUS_FIELD constant on models that have lifecycle_status to log status changes separately
  - RepeatableEntry works well for displaying audit log timeline in Infolist

  - Category filter for "has related model" uses `whereHas()` / `whereDoesntHave()` with relationship name
  - Completeness filter approximation with raw SQL since it's a computed value - weights the optional fields
  - Use custom sortable query `fn (Builder $query, string $direction)` for virtual/computed columns
  - ImageColumn with `defaultImageUrl()` can use UI Avatars API for placeholder images
  - Bulk actions can skip non-matching records gracefully and show notifications for both success and skipped
  - View/Edit actions can redirect to another resource using `->url(fn ($record) => OtherResource::getUrl('view', ['record' => $record]))`

  - Form statePath should be `'data'` to bind to `public array $data = []` property
  - Section components with `->description()` provide better UX for form grouping
  - When conditionally showing form fields, use `->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => ...)` and `->required(fn (Get $get): bool => ...)` together
  - Check for existing Wine Variant by wine_master_id + vintage_year before creating to prevent duplicates

  - `app/Filament/Resources/Pim/WineVariantResource/RelationManagers/SellableSkusRelationManager.php` (modified - enhanced with full lifecycle management)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For enum-typed fields in match expressions, use PHPDoc `@var 'val1'|'val2'|'val3'` annotation with `?? 'default'` to satisfy PHPStan
  - Use model constants for lifecycle status and source values for consistency (e.g., `STATUS_DRAFT`, `SOURCE_MANUAL`)
  - RelationManager can access owner record via `$this->ownerRecord` for generating related items
  - For intrinsic SKU generation, use standard producer configurations (6x750ml OWC, 12x750ml OWC, etc.)
  - Use bulk actions for managing multiple records: `BulkAction::make('name')->action(function ($records) {...})`
  - Empty state actions can duplicate header actions for better UX on empty relation managers
  - For integrity flags display, use badge with `getStateUsing()` to compute display from multiple boolean fields
