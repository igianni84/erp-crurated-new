## Codebase Patterns
- Enums should be PHP 8.1+ backed enums with `label()`, `color()`, and `icon()` helper methods for Filament integration
- Allocation-related enums go in `app/Enums/Allocation/`
- Use wine_variant_id + format_id as bottle SKU reference (no separate BottleSku model exists)
- Jobs go in `app/Jobs/{Module}/` - schedule in `routes/console.php` using `Schedule::job()->everyMinute()`
- Services go in `app/Services/{Module}/` - use DB::transaction() with lockForUpdate() for atomic quantity operations
- Filament Resources go in `app/Filament/Resources/{Module}/` with Pages subdirectory - use enum methods for badge styling
- Filament Wizard forms: use `CreateRecord\Concerns\HasWizard` trait in CreateXxx page class, override `form()` and `getSteps()`

## 2026-02-03 - US-002
- What was implemented: Verified that all three allocation enums already exist and meet acceptance criteria
- Files verified (no changes needed):
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/AllocationSourceType.php`
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/AllocationSupplyForm.php`
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/AllocationStatus.php`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Enums were created as part of US-001 setup, so this story was already complete
  - AllocationStatus includes transition helpers: `allowedTransitions()`, `canTransitionTo()`, `allowsConstraintEditing()`, `allowsConsumption()`, `isTerminal()`
  - All enums follow Filament patterns with label/color/icon methods
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-003
- What was implemented: AllocationConstraint model for authoritative commercial constraints on allocations
- Files changed:
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_03_260000_create_allocation_constraints_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Allocation/AllocationConstraint.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Allocation/Allocation.php` (added hasOne relationship and auto-create on allocation creation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AllocationConstraint is automatically created when an Allocation is created (via `created` event in Allocation model boot)
  - Constraints can only be edited when Allocation is in Draft status (validated in AllocationConstraint's `updating` event)
  - The `constraint()` relationship uses HasOne pattern; the FK is `allocation_id` on the constraints table with unique constraint
  - JSON array fields use `'array'` cast in Laravel and `@property array<string>|null` PHPDoc for PHPStan
  - Helper methods: `getAllChannels()`, `getAllCustomerTypes()` return available options; `isChannelAllowed()`, etc. for constraint checking

## 2026-02-03 - US-004
- What was implemented: LiquidAllocationConstraint model for liquid-specific allocation constraints
- Files changed:
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_03_270000_create_liquid_allocation_constraints_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Allocation/LiquidAllocationConstraint.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Allocation/Allocation.php` (added liquidConstraint() relationship and isLiquid()/isBottled() helpers)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - LiquidAllocationConstraint has a `saving` event that validates `allocation.supply_form === AllocationSupplyForm::Liquid`
  - Unlike AllocationConstraint, LiquidAllocationConstraint is NOT auto-created on Allocation creation (only applicable for liquid allocations)
  - Both constraint models follow the same pattern: unique FK to allocation_id, `updating` event to prevent edits on non-Draft allocations
  - Added `isLiquid()` and `isBottled()` helper methods to Allocation model for easier supply_form checks

## 2026-02-03 - US-005
- What was implemented: TemporaryReservation model for temporary holds on allocation quantity to prevent overselling
- Files changed:
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_03_280000_create_temporary_reservations_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Allocation/TemporaryReservation.php` (new)
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/ReservationContextType.php` (new) - checkout, negotiation, manual_hold
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/ReservationStatus.php` (new) - active, expired, cancelled, converted
  - `app/Jobs/Allocation/ExpireReservationsJob.php` (new) - scheduled job to expire reservations
  - `app/Models/Allocation/Allocation.php` (added temporaryReservations() and activeReservations() relationships)
  - `routes/console.php` (added scheduled job registration)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TemporaryReservation does NOT consume allocation - it only "blocks" quantity temporarily
  - ReservationStatus has `isActive()`, `isTerminal()`, `allowedTransitions()`, `canTransitionTo()` helpers like AllocationStatus
  - Model includes helper methods: `expire()`, `cancel()`, `convert()` for state transitions
  - Scopes `active()` and `needsExpiration()` are available for querying
  - Jobs go in `app/Jobs/{Module}/` directory structure
  - Laravel 11+ scheduling is done in `routes/console.php` using `Schedule::job()->everyMinute()`

## 2026-02-03 - US-006
- What was implemented: AllocationService for centralizing allocation business logic
- Files changed:
  - `app/Services/Allocation/AllocationService.php` (new)
- **Methods implemented:**
  - `activate(Allocation)`: draft → active transition
  - `close(Allocation)`: active/exhausted → closed transition
  - `consumeAllocation(Allocation, quantity)`: decrements remaining, increments sold with DB transaction locking
  - `checkAvailability(Allocation, quantity)`: checks if quantity is available (remaining - active_reservations >= quantity)
  - `getRemainingAvailable(Allocation)`: returns remaining - sum(active_reservations.quantity)
  - `canActivate(Allocation)`, `canClose(Allocation)`: helper methods for checking allowed transitions
  - `markAsExhausted(Allocation)`: active → exhausted transition (auto-called when remaining reaches 0)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Services go in `app/Services/{Module}/` directory structure
  - Use `DB::transaction()` with `lockForUpdate()` for atomic operations that modify quantities
  - Always double-check availability after acquiring lock to prevent race conditions
  - Status transitions should auto-trigger where appropriate (e.g., exhausted when remaining=0)
  - Use explicit exception messages that explain what's wrong and how to fix it

## 2026-02-03 - US-007
- What was implemented: AllocationResource for Filament admin panel with comprehensive list view
- Files changed:
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Allocation/AllocationResource.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Allocation/AllocationResource/Pages/ListAllocations.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Allocation/AllocationResource/Pages/CreateAllocation.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Allocation/AllocationResource/Pages/ViewAllocation.php` (new)
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Allocation/AllocationResource/Pages/EditAllocation.php` (new)
- **Features implemented:**
  - Navigation group 'Allocations' with cube-transparent icon
  - All required columns: id, bottle_sku, supply_form, source_type, status, total_qty, sold_qty, remaining_qty, availability_window, constraint_summary, updated_at
  - Status, source_type, supply_form shown as badges with colors and icons from enums
  - Near exhaustion indicator: remaining_qty shows danger color, bold text, and warning icon when < 10%
  - Filters: status (multi-select, default excludes Closed), source_type (multi-select), supply_form, wine_variant/bottle_sku, near_exhaustion toggle, trashed
  - Search: wine name, producer, allocation ID via searchable columns
  - Eager loading of relationships (wineVariant.wineMaster, format, constraint) via modifyQueryUsing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Filament Resources go in `app/Filament/Resources/{Module}/` with Pages subdirectory
  - Use `formatStateUsing()` with enum's `label()` method for badge text
  - Use `color()` and `icon()` from enum for badge styling
  - For computed columns, use `state()` callback to call model methods like `getBottleSkuLabel()`
  - For searchable computed columns, use `searchable(query: ...)` with custom query builder
  - Use `modifyQueryUsing()` on table for eager loading relationships
  - Default filter values with `->default()` to pre-populate filter (e.g., exclude Closed status)

## 2026-02-03 - US-008
- What was implemented: Create Allocation wizard - Step 1 (Bottle SKU selection)
- Files changed:
  - `app/Filament/Resources/Allocation/AllocationResource/Pages/CreateAllocation.php` (modified to add wizard)
- **Features implemented:**
  - Wizard-based form using `CreateRecord\Concerns\HasWizard` trait
  - Step 1: Bottle SKU selection with cascading selects:
    - Wine selection via autocomplete search (searches by name or producer)
    - Vintage selection (dynamically filtered by selected WineMaster)
    - Format selection (all available formats ordered by volume_ml)
  - Bottle SKU preview showing full label: Wine (Producer) Vintage - Format
  - Info message: "Allocation always happens at Bottle SKU level (Wine + Vintage + Format)"
  - `mutateFormDataBeforeCreate()` removes temporary wine_master_id field
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `CreateRecord\Concerns\HasWizard` trait for multi-step forms
  - For cascading selects: use `live()` + `afterStateUpdated()` to reset dependent fields
  - Use `hidden()` with `Get` callback to show/hide sections based on previous selections
  - Use `getSearchResultsUsing()` for custom autocomplete search logic
  - Use `getOptionLabelUsing()` to format existing option labels for display
  - Use `getAttribute()` instead of direct property access to avoid PHPStan strict type errors
