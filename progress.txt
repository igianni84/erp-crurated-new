## Codebase Patterns

- Use `./vendor/bin/pint --test` to check code style without making changes
- Laravel Pint is pre-configured in Laravel 12 as the default linter
- Use `php artisan test` to run all tests
- .env is configured for MySQL but falls back works with SQLite for testing
- MySQL 9.6.0 runs via `brew services start mysql`, CLI at `/opt/homebrew/bin/mysql`
- Use `php artisan db:show` to check database connection status
- Database `crurated_erp` uses utf8mb4_unicode_ci collation

# Progress Log

## 2026-02-03 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Initialized Laravel 12.49.0 project using `laravel new`
  - Configured .env and .env.example for MySQL (crurated_erp database)
  - Updated composer.json project name to crurated/erp
  - Initialized git repository on ralph/infrastructure branch
  - Added additional entries to .gitignore (SQLite, .last-branch, temp files)
- Files changed:
  - .env, .env.example (MySQL configuration)
  - .gitignore (added SQLite, temp files)
  - composer.json (project name)
  - All Laravel 12 scaffold files
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Laravel 12 comes with Pint pre-installed for linting
  - Default database is SQLite, need to explicitly configure MySQL
  - `php artisan serve` starts on port 8000 by default
  - Laravel 12 has built-in test infrastructure (PHPUnit + example tests)

## 2026-02-03 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Installed MySQL 9.6.0 via Homebrew (`brew install mysql`)
  - Started MySQL service (`brew services start mysql`)
  - Created `crurated_erp` database with utf8mb4_unicode_ci collation
  - Verified Laravel .env configuration connects correctly
  - Ran `php artisan migrate` successfully (users, cache, jobs tables)
  - Verified all tables and columns use snake_case naming convention
- Files changed:
  - No code files changed - this was database infrastructure setup
  - prd.json (marked US-002 as passing)
  - progress.txt (this log)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - MySQL CLI on macOS is at `/opt/homebrew/bin/mysql`
  - Use `brew services start mysql` to start the MySQL daemon
  - Use `php artisan db:show` to verify database connection and see stats
  - Laravel 12 default migrations create: users, cache, cache_locks, jobs, job_batches, failed_jobs, password_reset_tokens, sessions, migrations tables
  - All Laravel migrations follow snake_case convention by default
