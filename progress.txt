## Codebase Patterns
- Use `HasUuid` trait for UUID primary keys with `$table->uuid('id')->primary()` in migrations
- Use `Auditable` trait with `created_by`/`updated_by` columns and `auditLogs()` MorphMany relationship
- Use `SoftDeletes` trait with `$table->softDeletes()` in migrations
- Customer module enums go in `App\Enums\Customer\` namespace
- Customer module models go in `App\Models\Customer\` namespace
- Enums need `label()`, `color()`, and `icon()` methods for Filament compatibility
- Migration naming: `YYYY_MM_DD_XXXXXX_create_table_name_table.php`
- Use `foreignId()->constrained()->nullOnDelete()` for FK references to users table

## 2026-02-04 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created `PartyType` enum (individual, legal_entity) with label/color/icon methods
  - Created `PartyStatus` enum (active, inactive) with label/color/icon methods
  - Created `Party` model with HasUuid, Auditable, SoftDeletes traits
  - Created migration for `parties` table with unique constraint on (tax_id, jurisdiction)
  - Created `PartyRole` stub model for relationship placeholder (full implementation in US-002)
- Files changed:
  - app/Enums/Customer/PartyType.php (new)
  - app/Enums/Customer/PartyStatus.php (new)
  - app/Models/Customer/Party.php (new)
  - app/Models/Customer/PartyRole.php (new - stub)
  - database/migrations/2026_02_04_390000_create_parties_table.php (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Customer module uses `App\Enums\Customer\` and `App\Models\Customer\` namespaces
  - Migration sequence for Module K starts at 390000
  - PartyRole stub created to satisfy Party relationship, will be completed in US-002
