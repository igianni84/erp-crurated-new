## Codebase Patterns
- Enums should be PHP 8.1+ backed enums with `label()`, `color()`, and `icon()` helper methods for Filament integration
- Allocation-related enums go in `app/Enums/Allocation/`
- Use wine_variant_id + format_id as bottle SKU reference (no separate BottleSku model exists)

## 2026-02-03 - US-002
- What was implemented: Verified that all three allocation enums already exist and meet acceptance criteria
- Files verified (no changes needed):
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/AllocationSourceType.php`
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/AllocationSupplyForm.php`
  - `app/Enums/Allocation/AllocationStatus.php`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Enums were created as part of US-001 setup, so this story was already complete
  - AllocationStatus includes transition helpers: `allowedTransitions()`, `canTransitionTo()`, `allowsConstraintEditing()`, `allowsConsumption()`, `isTerminal()`
  - All enums follow Filament patterns with label/color/icon methods

## 2026-02-03 - US-003
- What was implemented: AllocationConstraint model for authoritative commercial constraints on allocations
- Files changed:
  - `database/migrations/2026_02_03_260000_create_allocation_constraints_table.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Allocation/AllocationConstraint.php` (new)
  - `app/Models/Allocation/Allocation.php` (added hasOne relationship and auto-create on allocation creation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AllocationConstraint is automatically created when an Allocation is created (via `created` event in Allocation model boot)
  - Constraints can only be edited when Allocation is in Draft status (validated in AllocationConstraint's `updating` event)
  - The `constraint()` relationship uses HasOne pattern; the FK is `allocation_id` on the constraints table with unique constraint
  - JSON array fields use `'array'` cast in Laravel and `@property array<string>|null` PHPDoc for PHPStan
  - Helper methods: `getAllChannels()`, `getAllCustomerTypes()` return available options; `isChannelAllowed()`, etc. for constraint checking
