# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `$table->uuid('id')->primary()` for model primary keys with HasUuid trait
- Models use Auditable trait with created_by/updated_by foreign keys to users
- Enums follow pattern: value cases with label(), color(), icon() methods
- Inventory module: app/Models/Inventory/, app/Enums/Inventory/
- Module B branch is based on ralph/module-a-allocations branch

## 2026-02-04 - US-B001
- **Implemented**: Location model as base for physical storage management
- **Files created**:
  - app/Enums/Inventory/LocationType.php (5 location types with label/color/icon methods)
  - app/Enums/Inventory/LocationStatus.php (3 statuses with operational methods)
  - app/Models/Inventory/Location.php (HasUuid, Auditable, SoftDeletes)
  - database/migrations/2026_02_04_100000_create_locations_table.php
- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - Location model relationships to InboundBatch, SerializedBottle, InventoryCase were deferred as those models don't exist yet
  - The serialization_authorized flag is key for US-B022 (serialization location blocker)
  - LocationStatus.canReceiveInventory() and canDispatchInventory() will be used by movement validation
